            When using hexagons to model coverage areas, base station transmitters are depicted as eitherbeing in the center of the cell (center-excited cells) or on three of the six cell vertices (edge-excitedcells). Normally, omnidirectional antennas are used in center-excited cells and sectored directionalantennas are used in corner-excited cells. Practical considerations usually do not allow base stationsto be placed exactly as they appear in the hexagonal layout. Most system designs permit a base station to be positioned up to one-fourth the cell radius away from the ideal location
